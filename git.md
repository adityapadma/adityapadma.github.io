### Notes for every time I forget How to commit this to GitHub
```bash
$ git add .
$ git status # Lists all new or modified files to be committed
$ git commit -m "Second commit"
$ git push -u origin master
```

I am interested in a whole lot of things. My curious thought process doesn't let me be fixed on one thing so I end up trying and learning and reading about many things. I go on all possible pathways of thought I can think of.

But there are 3 things that I am broadly interested in and want to work in these areas. Technology (**Computer Science**) and how it affects the social world (**Social Science**) we inhabit and how we can use arts and (**Design**) to connect with other people in the said social world. 

Design; Movies; F1; Space Exploration;
Story Telling; Game Design and Development.
