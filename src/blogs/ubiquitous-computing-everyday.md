excerpt: "Mark Weiser dreamed of computers that would vanish into the background of everyday life. Decades later, are we any closer — or have we built the wrong kind of invisible?"
---

Mark Weiser wrote in 1991 that "the most profound technologies are those that disappear." He imagined a world where computation would be woven so deeply into the fabric of everyday objects and spaces that we would stop noticing it altogether — the way we stop noticing writing once we've learned to read, or electricity once it became reliable infrastructure.

We are living in that world now. Sort of.

## The Promise of the Invisible

Weiser's vision was generous. He imagined technology disappearing *in service of human experience* — freeing us to focus on tasks, people, relationships, rather than on the mechanics of computation. The computer would be a quiet background hum, not a demanding foreground presence.

What actually happened is more complicated. Our devices have indeed become infrastructural — we don't think about TCP/IP when we send a message any more than we think about plumbing when we turn on a tap. But the *interfaces* that sit atop that infrastructure have become, if anything, more attention-hungry, not less. The smartphone is the least invisible object in most people's lives.

This is not a failure of technology. It's a failure of incentive design.

## Attention as a Design Choice

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. The attention economy — the system by which digital platforms compete for human focus — emerged as a consequence of advertising-funded business models. When your revenue depends on eyeballs, you design for eyeballs.

But this was never inevitable. Ubiquitous computing, in the tradition Weiser imagined, doesn't require your attention. A thermostat that learns your preferences, a doorway that recognises you, a desk lamp that knows when you're in a deep focus state and dims accordingly — these are computations that serve you silently.

> "The goal of ubiquitous computing is not to make better computers. It's to make computing disappear so that life can become better."

The interesting design question is: which parts of computation should be visible, and which should be invisible? Complete invisibility carries its own risks — the smart home that silently logs everything, the wearable that nudges behaviour without your awareness. Invisibility is not neutral. It's a power relationship.

## Objects That Know Things

One thread of ubiquitous computing research I find genuinely exciting is the idea of objects that carry their own histories. A chair that knows how long it's been used. A plant pot that tracks moisture over months. A notebook that remembers which pages were touched.

This sounds like surveillance. But it doesn't have to be. The key distinction is *who* the data serves. If the chair reports your sitting posture to an insurance company, that's extraction. If the chair helps *you* understand your body's patterns over time — patterns you could never track manually — that might be liberation.

In South Asian contexts, this design question takes on particular textures. The shared household, the multi-generational home, the object passed between relatives — these all complicate the individual-centric data models that ubiquitous computing typically assumes. A teacup that carries one person's story is interesting. A teacup that carries a family's story is literature.

## What I'm Thinking About

I'm currently exploring how Tangible User Interfaces can embody *collective* rather than individual memory — systems that serve households, communities, or lineages rather than isolated users. This requires rethinking the basic unit of the "user" in UX design.

It also requires taking seriously the aesthetics and material cultures of the communities being designed for. The physical vocabulary of objects varies enormously across contexts. What feels natural to hold, to rotate, to share — these are culturally specific intuitions that should be doing design work.

Weiser's dream isn't dead. But it needs to be retold by more people, from more places, before it can come true.
