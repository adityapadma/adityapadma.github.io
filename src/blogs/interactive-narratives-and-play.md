excerpt: "Games are the most sophisticated interactive systems humans have ever built for pleasure. So why does HCI treat them as an afterthought?"

I want to make a controversial claim: the most advanced human-computer interaction research happening right now is not being published in CHI or UIST. It's being done by game designers.

Not because games are more important than productivity tools or accessibility research. But because games are the only domain where *interaction itself* is the point — where the quality of the feedback loop, the responsiveness of the system, the legibility of the rules, are not in service of some other goal. They *are* the goal.

## The Feedback Loop as Aesthetic Object

In most HCI contexts, the interaction is a means to an end. You click the button to send the email. You scroll to find the information. The interface is successful when it disappears — when the friction is low enough that you forget you're using a machine.

Games invert this. The friction is often the point. Dark Souls is brutal precisely because dying repeatedly teaches you the grammar of the world. Papers, Please makes bureaucratic form-filling feel like moral anguish. Untitled Goose Game turns petty mischief into a poetics of agency.

In each case, the designer has made deliberate choices about what to make easy, what to make hard, and what to make *feel good to fail at*. These are among the most sophisticated interaction design decisions I can think of — and they're almost never discussed in HCI literature.

## Narrative as Interface

One of my persistent research interests is the intersection of interactive narrative and interface design. This is a space that sits uncomfortably between game studies, literary theory, and HCI — and I think it's exactly the right place to be uncomfortable.

The question I keep returning to: what does it mean for a *story* to have an interface? When the player of a narrative game makes a choice, they're doing something very different from choosing between radio buttons on a form. They're choosing who they are, or who they want to be, within a fictional world.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam. This is why games like Disco Elysium or 80 Days produce such distinct phenomenological experiences — the interface is not separate from the story. *The interface is the story.*

## What This Means for Design

If we take this seriously, it changes how we think about a lot of supposedly mundane interface design:

- **Onboarding** is a tutorial level. How do you teach the grammar of a system without boring the player? Without overwhelming them? Without making them feel stupid?
- **Error messages** are failure states. In a good game, failing is informative — you learn something about the system's rules. Most software error messages teach nothing. "Something went wrong" is not a meaningful failure state.
- **Progress indicators** are feedback loops. Loading bars are the least interesting version of this. Games have figured out how to make *waiting* feel like anticipation.
- **Empty states** are the beginning of a story. A blank document, a new account, an onboarding screen — these are invitations. Most software treats them like awkward silences.

## South Asian Games and Stories That Don't Exist Yet

One thread I've been pulling on: there is a vast archive of South Asian storytelling traditions — oral epics, devotional poetry, performative narratives, trickster tales — that has barely been touched by interactive media.

The *Panchatantra* is a collection of interlocking animal fables designed specifically for teaching through story. It's almost structurally a branching narrative game. *Barahmasa* poetry cycles through months and seasons as emotional registers. The *Jataka* tales are a database of past lives. These are not just content waiting to be adapted — they're *structural models* for interactive narrative that Western game design hasn't discovered.

I want to build with these forms. Not as nostalgia or cultural performance, but as genuine alternatives to the dominant vocabularies of game design — the hero's journey, the power fantasy, the puzzle box.

There are different ways to tell a story. There are different ways to play.
