There is a famous Ursula K. Le Guin essay called "A Non-Euclidean View of California as a Cold Place to Be" in which she argues that utopia has been imagined — for most of Western literary history — as a destination, a point to arrive at, a finished thing. She wants instead a utopia that is ongoing, provisional, always being made. A direction rather than a place.

I think about this a lot when I encounter speculative design.

## Design Fiction and Its Discontents

Speculative design — sometimes called design fiction, or critical design, or futures design — is the practice of building artefacts and scenarios from imagined futures in order to provoke questions about the present. You make a prop from a world where social credit scores determine housing access. You prototype a device from a future where memory is commodified. The object doesn't solve a problem; it *poses* one.

This is genuinely useful. The best speculative design work operates like good science fiction: it estranges us from our assumptions, makes the familiar strange enough to examine. Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, who helped establish the field, describe their work as inhabiting "the space between reality as we know it and the impossible."

But there's a tension I keep noticing: whose reality is the baseline?

## The View From Somewhere

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. When Western design schools produce speculative futures, they tend to speculate from a particular starting point — a world of relative stability, reliable infrastructure, strong institutions, and individualist social structures. The dystopias they imagine are, in a sense, *luxuries*: they require a certain baseline of functioning society to deviate from.

For a large fraction of the world's population, the speculative dystopia is already the present. Mass surveillance is not a future scenario; it is currently active. Algorithmic bias in lending and healthcare is not a thought experiment; it is today's operating condition.

This doesn't mean speculative design is useless. It means speculative design needs to happen from more vantage points. It needs designers who are speculating from Mumbai or Nairobi or Lahore — who have different baselines, different pressure points, different things to hope for and fear.

> "Every utopia is someone's dystopia. The question is: whose comfort are you taking as the starting point?"

## What Speculation Looks Like from Here

When I try to do speculative design from an Indian context — or more specifically, from my own position as someone between IIITD, Delhi's material culture, and a deep interest in science fiction — the futures I find interesting are different from the canonical ones.

I am less interested in the singularity. I am more interested in what it would mean to design a technology that could sit comfortably alongside a puja shelf, or work within the rhythms of a joint family household, or operate in a city where power outages are routine and streets are not mapped.

I'm interested in technologies that make collective memory — the specific kind that lives in oral traditions, in recipes, in the way an elder corrects your pronunciation — into something that can be transmitted without being digitised. This sounds paradoxical. It is. That's why it's worth speculating about.

## Three Futures I Actually Want to Build

**1. The Archive of Impermanence.** A system for preserving ephemeral cultural practices — the specific way a drumbeat varies between two villages, the particular inflection of a blessing — without flattening them into data. Not a database. A relationship.

**2. The Neighbourhood Interface.** A public installation that makes a locality's collective mood visible — not through social media sentiment analysis, but through physical signals: the smells coming from different kitchens at mealtimes, the sounds of different festivals, the rhythms of people coming and going. Technology as community mirror.

**3. The Heirloom Device.** An object designed to be passed between generations — that accumulates meaning through use rather than depreciating, that carries the marks of previous owners as features rather than defects. Antithetical to planned obsolescence. Designed for the long now.

## The Futures We Refuse

Le Guin's point about utopia applies here. The most useful speculative design is not the design of finished futures — shiny objects from tomorrow's WIRED magazine. It's the design of *directions*. What are we moving toward? What are we moving away from? What are we refusing to imagine, and why?

The refusal is often the most interesting data. What futures are systematically absent from design school workshops? Whose fears and desires never make it into the futures we prototype? The gaps in speculation are a map of whose imagination has been excluded from the conversation.

Filling those gaps is not just a matter of equity — though it is that. It's also a matter of intelligence. Futures that emerge from more places, more experiences, more contradictions, will be stranger and more useful than the ones we keep recycling.

The goal is not a single speculated future. The goal is a bigger imagination.
